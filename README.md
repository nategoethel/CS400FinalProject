# Congress Search
This application was completed as a final project for my CS 400 (Programming III) course. I created a standalone Java application that allows the user to search for congressmen and congresswomen as well as view statistics about the make up of the House and Senate across gender and party lines.

# Running the Application
To run the application, download the project folder and run the Final.jar file.
